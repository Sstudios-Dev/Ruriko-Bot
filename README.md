# Installation
## üìã Clone the repository with the ``git`` tool
```cmd
> git clone https://github.com/Sstudios-Dev/Ruriko-Bot.git
```
this step is very important for the bot to work that's why you need `git` this step must not be skipped

## üíª change the configuration file
after cloning the repository you will find a file called `config.example.json` 
you have to rename that file to `config.json` and remove the `.example` from it this is a very important step for the bot to work and not give errors

```json
{
    "ownerBot": "505xxxxxxxx@c.us",
    "prefix": "!",
    "nao": "SauceNAO-key",
    "openAiKey": "OpenAI-key",
    "authorStick": "@SstudiosDev",
    "packStick": "rurikoBot",
    "language": "Coming soon"
}
```

`ownerBot`: change the `505` to your country prefix and everything glued together [Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_country_calling_codes)

`prefix`: there you can change the bot prefix which defaults to `!`

`nao`: SauceNAO API key. Obtain it [here](https://saucenao.com/user.php) by creating an account.
